        <p>
          Terrorblade is the Demon Marauderâ€”an outlaw hellion whom even other
          demons fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cosmic iconoclast, he stole from the Demon Lords, ignored the
          codified rites that should have bound his behavior, and broke every
          law of the seven infernal regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A short, brutal trial ensued, with many dead on all sides, and he was
          finally incarcerated in Foulfell, a hidden dimension where demonkind
          imprison their own.

              <p> Yurnero the Juggernaut, named after the martial tradition that he swore to preserve and protect, is the last of his masked kind who drowned beneath the waves that deluged the ancient Isle of Masks.
            </p>
            <p>
                No one has ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Yurnero the Juggernaut. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last practitioner of the art, Yurnero's confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his expression.

                  <p>
                    Jah'rakal is an intolerable scoundrel, even for a troll. As such, being kicked out of the troll encampment only served to fuel his anger.</p>
                <p>A prickly and contentious race, trolls thrive on argument and strife, missing no excuse to raise their voices in dispute. Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing nothing
                </p>

                <p>
                   Now he roams the world as the Troll Warlord, bitter and angry, the Imperial high commander of an army of one.

                      <p>
                        Morphling can be as elusive as he is deadly
                    </p>
                    <p>An elemental power at one with the tides of the ocean, capricious and unconstrained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unbound by any permanent shape, the Morphling Alters Attributes to match his needs and Morphs into a replication of his foes, mimicking their capabilities, making them fight against a copy of themselves.
